Some specific stats questions
How is uncertainty evaluated in classical regression?
How is uncertainty evaluated in Bayes stats
How we handle uncertainty on user level (one sampled t test)
If I want to control for a confounder, is it okay to just choose a sample of the same proportion as confounder (say, 60%male / 40% female)
How we treat uncertainty in time series
Maximum likelihood and joint distributions
Cobb douglas function is multiplicative
But in log it is additive
Does it mean that coefficients are independent?
There was some article about matrix derivatives
No degrees of freedom in matrix formula for variance. But they are in other formulas
Why do we use XXt? Why do we need to combine together Xs?
If my model is just multiplicative, how would I evaluate uncertainty?
If I have a power model?
Каким образом вопрос observational-causal сводится к фильтрации (по confounder-у)
Fixed effects vs random effects?
Why can we interpret P(x) or even P(x|a) as distribution? And can we?
Conditional probability: why we divide by P(B)? ( divide by number 0<x<1)
When we use the formula to calculate uncertainty for regression, we use degrees of freedom. But in matrix form we do not. How so?
What happens if you delete intercept from regression
Error term - assumption level, unobserved
Residuals - are in data
Residuals in OLS always spherical?
What is a moment in statistics?
(Interesting when connected to degrees of freedom)
! You are not trying to explain variation in Y if researching causal inference
Problems with degrees of freedom explanation:

start speaking linear algebra
Explain the independent pieces of information part and say that we have to adjust by n-1). but never why it is an n-1, not n-3, not n/2 or whatever.
Never explain why we should even think of independence of those pieces of information. Why do we care?
Answer is somewhere in variance decomposition!
Answer: each member of the sample has variance sigma. Total variance should be n*sigma. When we take the average out, it  becomes (n-1)*sigma.
Also use the peculiarity of the mean to show: (xi-avgx)^2
Avgx^2 + var = xi^2
Это нормализация? Поднятие дисперсии до шкалы иксов?
Линейно ли уменьшается uncertainty с увеличением выборки?
Effects over time - how relates to experiment
Sample ratio mismatch
Degrees of freedom v2:
Почему важно не n, а степени свободы
Складываем ли мы дисперсию каждого из n и дисперсию среднего? И если да, то почему?
Idea: forget about degrees of freedom.
Just know that
(xi-xmean)^2 = (n-1)sigma (n-1 degree of freedom). Would be all n degrees of freedom if used m instead of mu
And that
(xmean -mu)^2 = sigma/n (alwyays one degree of freedom. When looking for chisq you will be subtracting just one mean from your mu)
Any difference from mean is also random value.
So, we can square the difference and get chisq distribution
Article by Knox and Lowe and Mummolo - they suggest bounds to a collider bias. But how?
In multiple regression a coefficient is just like a regression of residuals on your X. But why and how does it work
And how is it different to instrumental variables
Why n*chisq is not the multiple of squared mean differences (but chisq with n degrees of freedom)
Think about it:
variances add, standard deviations don’t.

В некоторых источниках распределние называют X, а в некоторых - P(x)
Вопрос:
При оценке population variance мы используем sample variance. Но почему без confidence intervals? Мы могли бы их получить через chisq?
====
Почему когда смотрим на распределение, измеряем размер в std, а не в variance? Можно ли выразить confidence intervals с помощью variance, а не std (0,95 = 1.96*sigma (это связано с линейностью?)
Variance of sampling distribution of the SUM is n*var. variance of sampling distribution of the MEAN is var/n. The former grows with n, while the latter decreases. How is that? Do we not get any advantage for larger n if we measure the sum(hints: SUM is always bigger than MEAN, so gives even bigger intervals when squared). (Also: What kind of mu do you measure when working with sum?)
Confidence intervals for experiments in statistics split by day. Intervals are expected to decrease (Variance of sampling distribution of the mean), but do they?

Joint = Conditional/Marginal
Marginal called this way because it's on the margin of the table (like those you do for Chi-SQ test)

Linalg and Calculus connection
Linalg as opportunity to do backdoor calculus

from: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-relationship-between-linear-algebra-and-calculus
Matrix is local approximation by linear function
the Jacobian is precisely the matrix that represents the linear map called the total derivative
Multi variable calculus is essentially about approximation of maps by linear maps (matrices). Linear algebra is about the structure of matrices
Linear algebra really becomes important for differential equations.


Idea that I got from the course by Alex Dainyak on Discrete maths.
Finding the number combinations can be represented as a tree and boils down to two rules:
- if you are adding a new branch - you are adding the amount of combinations
- if you are going down in the branch - you are multiplying the amount of combinations (like in the for loop)
